# The All-in-One Algorand Codespace

Welcome to the all-in-one Algorand Codespace! This repository is designed to provide you with everything you need to start developing on the Algorand blockchain, whether you're attending a workshop, completing a challenge, or just exploring on your own.

## üåü Quick Start Guide

### üöÄ Start with Codespaces
This is the fastest way to get up and running!

1. **Create a Codespace:**

     *Click the image above to watch a quick 15-second video on how to create your Codespace.*
   - Click the green "Code" button at the top right of this page.
   - Select "Create codespace on main".
   - Once your Codespace is fully loaded, run the following command in the terminal:
     ```bash
     sh setup.sh
     ```

2. **Start Coding:**
   - Open the `main.py` file to start coding and interact with the Algorand blockchain (no smart contracts needed).
   - To start a smart contract/dApp project, run:
     ```bash
     algokit init
     ```

3. **Workshop Follow-Along:**
   - If you're participating in a workshop, the code we‚Äôll be using is available [here](https://github.com/Ganainmtech/python_algokit_demo).

4. **Explore on Your Own:**
   - Use this environment to write your own scripts or modify existing ones.

### üíª Advanced Setup for Local Development

Prefer a local environment? Follow these steps:

#### üß∞ Prerequisites

- Install Python 3.12 or higher.
- Install AlgoKit.
- Install Docker (for running a local Algorand network).
